# NLP

NLP_project_Codecademy is a Codecademy Pro Portfolio final project for "Apply Natural Language Processing with Python" path. Its main objective is to practice NLP skills and apply them on the real data.

The project was done with Python and Jupyter Notebook. 
Main libraries used are Pandas, NumPy, re, Matplotlib, NLTK, gensim.

Data set is provided by Codecademy, it is the National University of Singapore SMS Corpus data set, made publicly available by The National University of Singapore. 

I have used this SMS Corpus to practice several NLP techniques learnt in the course such as:
- Natural language parsing with regular expressions and Chunking
- Bag-of-words language model, Word frequency and n-gram analysis
- Term frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- Word embeddings
